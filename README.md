## Features

List of features ready and TODOs for future development
* The public Relations DB Visual Force Page allows the user to select an idol from a list of current Idols from SJP and a table surfaces with information displaying all the Public Relation events relating to the     * idol. A link that displays the Public Relation event name takes the user to the detail page for the event, allowing for more granular detail.
* Awesome feature 2
* Awesome feature 3

To-do list:
* For the Public Relations DB, future implementaitons will allow the user to be redirected to a new VFP that will
